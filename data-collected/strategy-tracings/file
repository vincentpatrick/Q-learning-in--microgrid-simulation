The strategy tracing dataset is a set of actions that the agents perform at every timestep of the simulation

In every hour of the simulation, it showed how the agent's action has an effect on the cost.

in the strategy tracing table, there are variables 
State --> the state consist of the current net load of the system at the different timesteps, 
action --> the action the agent takes at each timestep
cost --> the total cost of the operation in the microgrid at each timestep.
Load --> the current electrical load of the system.
pv --> the current solar pv generation in the system.
